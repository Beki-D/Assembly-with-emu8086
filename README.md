This repo contains assembly codes that I wrote with emu8086

This program is a simple implementation of a calculator in x86 Assembly language. It performs the following actions:

    * Prompts the user to enter two numbers, one at a time
    * Prompts the user to choose an operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division)
    * Based on the operation chosen by the user, performs the calculation and displays the result on a new line
    * If the operation chosen by the user is not one of the four supported operations, it displays an error message
    * The program ends after displaying the result or error message.
